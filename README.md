# Remotive Labs and Android Emulator

This is a set of Python scripts to redirect data from Remotive Labs broker to AAOS emulator.

![Example](docs/source/example.gif)

Check the [video](media/video_example_location_broker_to_emu_720.mov) in */media* for an example on how location can be sent from Remotive Labs broker
to AAOS emulator.

## Setup

It is highly recommended that you read the documentation in *docs/build/html/index.html*,
as it describes the steps in more details. It can be tricky to make it work if you miss
some configurations.

Make sure to install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the Android Studio Preview version:

## Run

Open up a session on [Remotive Labs Broker](https://demo.remotivelabs.com/). Start the playback, make sure to pick `configuration_android`.

### Send Location

Run the [AAOS Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
For sending location, you can use an user image such as:
* Automotive 12L with Play Store ARM 64 v8a System Image
    * If your machine is **ARM** based. It is an user build with GAS.
* Automotive 12L with Play Store Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image
    * If your machine is **x86** based. It is an user build with GAS.


Include the credentials from the broker as well as the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE signals:
```bash
$ python3 br_location_to_emu.py --url $URL --x_api_key $KEY --namespace android --signal LATITUDE --signal LONGITUDE
```

### Set VHAL Properties
To manipulate VHAL properties, you must use an userdebug build:
* Android Automotive 13 "Tiramisu" with Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image
    * It does not contain GAS, but it is userdebug.

Run the emulator via [command line](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline):
```bash
$ emulator @$avd_name -selinux permissive -no-snapshot
```
Note that you must set SELinux as permissive mode.

If you want to send VHAL property values to AAOS emulator:
```bash
$ python3 br_props_to_aaos.py --namespace android --url $URL --x_api_key $KEY --signal $SIGNAL
```
alternatively
```bash
$ PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python python3 br_props_to_aaos.py --url $URL --x_api_key $KEY --signal $SIGNAL
```
Send the signals you want by always putting the flag *--signal* alongside its name.
